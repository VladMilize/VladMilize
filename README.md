## Exercise 01 -- Success!
Check out my Personal Github account: [Vlad Milize](https://github.com/VladMilize)

## Hi there 👋

I'm trying to navigate my way through life by learning and maximizing the knowledge I attain!

### 💡 What People Should Know About Me

I believe that deep down, we all carry a little sadness with us, even if it's hidden. Negative emotions tend to bubble up first, and it's up to each person to decide how much they let that flood their mind. On a lighter note, I tend to ramble on about the most random things when I'm powered by caffeine (as you can probably tell from this 😅).

### 🛠️ Personal Projects

None for now, but I'm definitely interested in building something personal with **Flutter**—perhaps a feature-rich app that reflects my interests. CMSC 23 was fun (even if tedious at times), and I'd love to apply what I learned!

### 💻 Known Programming Languages

- **Flutter**
- **C**
- **Python**
- **Java**

_**Disclaimer:** Knowing ≠ being good at it 🤷‍♂️_

---

### 🎯 Hobbies

- 🏊‍♂️ Swimming
- 🔧 Tinkering with hardware/electronics
- 🌐 Exploring browser extensions

I tend to forget my hobbies when asked, so I'll update this as I remember more. But one thing's for sure—if I had unlimited money, I'd definitely be collecting shoes (especially comfy ones 🥿).
