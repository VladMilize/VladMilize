## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm trying to navigate my way through life by learning and maximizing the knowledge I attain!

Edit # 1 for CMSC 100 hehe:
a. What people should know about me
Talking about oneself, I feel like we are by default even in the back of our minds in a sad state of mind. Negative emotions are just the first ones to squeeze out of our brainpipes and it depends on every individual how much we clog our let flood within us. On a positive note, I spout the most random, weird, and lengthy stuff when I'm fueled by strong caffeine (such as when I wrote this LOL).
b. Personal Projects
None as of now but I am very much interested in creating some type of personal application that have personal features TBD via flutter - I enjoyed CMSC 23 even if it was sometimes tedious.
c. Known programming languages
Flutter, C, Python, Java .......... Know =/= Good >.<
d. Hobbies
I love swimming, tinkering with my own hardware/electronics, and am an enjoyer of browser extensions. I really forget my actual hobbies and interests when asked, I'll just edit in the future but yeah that's it I think. Oh if I had unlimited money I would probably be collecting shoes, I love shoes -- especially comfy ones.
